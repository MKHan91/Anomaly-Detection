# Anomaly Detection
<!-- BVMS anomaly detection with AE and/or VAE  
Clearning up the code   -->

## Introduction
This code originally was written for **turbine diagnosis.**   
For diagnosis, our team used feature image which extracted from blade vibration signal was used as train and test data.  

But, unfortunately the detail explanation and dataset release are trade secret.  
**therefore, this code is operated by replacing the dataset with open dataset.**

## Requirements
This code was tested with Tensorflow 1.12.0, CUDA 8.0 and Ubuntu 18.04
